The Secure Shell (SSH)

The Secure Shell (SSH) protocol is a method for securely sending commands to a computer over an unsecured network.  
SSH uses cryptography to authenticate and encrypt connections between devices.

SSH also allows for tunneling (port forwarding), enabling data packets to cross networks that they would not otherwise be able to cross.

SSH is commonly used for:
- Controlling servers remotely
- Managing infrastructure
- Transferring files securely

SSH Command Format

```bash
ssh targetusername@targetwebsite_or_ip -p portnumber
